# 🧠 Final Project - Image Classification with CNN | IDCAMP 2024
This project is my final submission to graduate from IDCamp 2024 - Intermediate Level, where I’m proud to be one of the 1,950 selected scholars who successfully advanced to this stage after passing the basic level.

# 🎯 Project Objective
To build an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can accurately classify input images. The goal is to train a model capable of making correct predictions based on given images.

# 🗂️ Dataset
* Source: 
* The dataset contains images of cars and bikes.
* Total images: Over 2,000, creating an ideal environment for training a high-performing CNN model.
